# window_asset_pyqt6

A python PqT6 boiler-plate that aims to simplify the creation of your windows.

This library has been created as a drop-in replacement for the tkinter version, thus, clashes might occur if the tkinter and the pyqt6 versions are imported into the same file as is (i.e. via a from window_asset_pyqt6 import WindowAsset;from window_asset_tkinter import WindowAsset )
